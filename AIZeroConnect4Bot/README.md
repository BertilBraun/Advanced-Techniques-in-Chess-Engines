# AlphaZero-Clone: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Board Games

Welcome to the **AlphaZero-Clone** repository! This project replicates the deep reinforcement learning approaches pioneered by AlphaZero, focusing initially on Chess and extending to other classic board games. The goal is to create an optimized, scalable, and maintainable framework for training AI agents capable of mastering complex games through self-play and iterative learning.

## Project Overview

**AlphaZero-Clone** is a Python-based project inspired by the AlphaZero algorithm, aiming to replicate its success in mastering games like Go, Chess, and Shogi. Starting with simpler implementations of Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Checkers, the project incrementally scales up to Chess, ensuring correctness and optimization at each step.

Key objectives include:

- Implementing self-play mechanisms using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).
- Facilitating iterative training with continuous model updates.
- Optimizing performance through parallel processing and efficient algorithms.
- Maintaining code readability and modularity for ease of understanding and extension.

### Training Pipeline

The training pipeline follows these steps:

1. **Self-Play Generation:**
   - Multiple workers generate self-play games using the current neural network model.
   - MCTS guides the move selection during self-play.

2. **Data Collection:**
   - Game states, move probabilities, and game outcomes are stored for training.

3. **Training:**
   - The neural network is trained on the collected data to predict move probabilities (policy) and game outcomes (value).
   - Training is performed in parallel across multiple nodes to accelerate learning.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Periodically, new models are evaluated against previous versions to ensure improvement.
   - Best-performing models are promoted for continued training and self-play.

## Supported Games

- **Tic-Tac-Toe:** Basic implementation for initial testing and verification.
- **Connect Four:** Intermediate complexity to ensure correct game state handling.
- **Checkers:** Transitioning to more complex game mechanics and strategies.
- **Chess:** The primary focus for deploying the AlphaZero-like algorithms.
