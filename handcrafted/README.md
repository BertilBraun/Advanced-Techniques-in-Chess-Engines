# Handcrafted Chess Bot Project

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a competitive chess bot in Python, utilizing the python-chess library. Designed to operate in a single-threaded environment without the use of machine learning or extensive databases, this bot focuses on strategic move generation and board evaluation through a variety of advanced algorithms and techniques. The goal is to create a chess engine that can provide a challenging experience for players, incorporating both classical chess strategies and innovative computational methods.

## Core Features and Improvements

Below is an ordered list of features and improvements that will be implemented in the chess bot, arranged from most crucial to least, based on their impact on the bot's performance and sophistication:

1. **Negamax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Implement the Negamax algorithm enhanced with alpha-beta pruning to efficiently search the game tree by pruning unlikely branches, thus reducing the number of nodes evaluated.

2. **Iterative Deepening**: Employ iterative deepening to dynamically adjust the depth of search, optimizing time management and improving move selection accuracy.

3. **Transposition Table**: Utilize a transposition table to store and recall evaluations of previously encountered positions, reducing computation time and improving search efficiency.

4. **Quiescence Search**: Incorporate quiescence search to extend the search at positions with pending tactical sequences, ensuring the engine evaluates only positions that are relatively stable.

5. **Move Ordering**: Implement move ordering to prioritize moves that are likely to be stronger (e.g., captures, promotions, checks) to enhance the efficiency of the alpha-beta pruning.

6. **Tapered Evaluation**: Develop a nuanced board evaluation that adjusts according to the game phase (opening, middlegame, endgame), allowing for more accurate assessments of positions.

7. **Piece-Square Tables**: Apply piece-square tables to guide piece placement, improving the positional play of the bot based on the stage of the game.

8. **Evaluation Function Enhancements**: Enhance the evaluation function with advanced metrics such as pawn structure analysis, king safety, mobility, control of center, bishop pair advantage, and rook placement.

9. **Adaptive Move Ordering**: Advance the move ordering system with dynamic evaluations based on the current board state and historical performance of similar moves, to further refine move prioritization.

10. **Lazy Evaluation**: Implement lazy evaluation strategies, conducting a full evaluation only when a preliminary assessment indicates that the position is likely to impact the decision-making process significantly.

11. **Aspiration Windows**: Use aspiration windows in the alpha-beta search to narrow down the search window based on expected scores, widening it only if the actual score falls outside this window.

12. **Selective Search Extensions**: Perform selective search extensions for critical types of moves, such as checks and captures, to explore potentially game-changing tactics more deeply.

## Project Management and Contribution

This project will be developed incrementally, with each component being carefully integrated and tested to ensure optimal performance and stability. The project will be open for contributions, and collaborators are encouraged to participate in the development, testing, and refinement of the chess bot. Performance benchmarks and gameplay testing will guide the development process, with a focus on continuously enhancing the bot's capabilities and user experience.

## Getting Started

- Setup instructions, training procedures, and how to run the engine will be detailed in the project documentation.
